## About SimVector

SimVector is a VueJS, Laravel and TangramJS based aviation live map, primarily focussing on mapping of simulation data (via VATSIM, IVAO, PilotEdge, Virtual Airlines, etc.). Users can use the interactive map to zoom into airports with AMDBs, complete with gate locations, powered by open source data.

## Using SimVector

End users of SimVector can navigate to https://simvector.net where they can experience the full application with the source code contained in this repository.

## Installing SimVector, along with a few notes.

For those interested in hosting SimVector themselves for a VA, it's complicated at the moment, but easily doable with the source code provided. You're highly encouraged, however, to seek out using our online service, which takes care of all the complicated bits for you.

If you're installing SimVector for local development, you'll require some datasource API keys, including:
- Nextzen (https://nextzen.org/) which has all the basemap data.
- Cardinal Horizon Tile Server (Coming Soon) which has all the aviation data (Airspace and airports).

## Financial Contributions

IF this project has made a difference in your flight simulation or professional experinece, consider making a financial contribution! It's not free to host the main website along with the tile server.
